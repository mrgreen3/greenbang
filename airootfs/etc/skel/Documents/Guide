## Pacman (Live Session)

To use `pacman` or a browser in the live session, you need a working network connection.

- **Wired (Ethernet)** connections work automatically.
- **Wireless** connections can be configured via the network icon on the panel:
  - Left-click the icon
  - Select your network from the list
  - Enter your Wi-Fi password

---

## Installation Tips and Tricks

If your live session runs out of disk space, you can remount the live filesystem with more space:

```bash
sudo mount -o remount,size=8G /run/archiso/cowspace
```

---

## Installation

To begin installation:

1. Right-click on the desktop  
2. Select **Install** from the main menu

The installer is menu-driven and easy to follow.

> Need help with partitions?  
> Use **GParted**, available via the Openbox menu under **Settings**.

## Post-Install Steps

### üß† Microcode Notice

GreenBANG includes **both** `intel-ucode` and `amd-ucode` microcode packages to support a wide range of CPUs.

You only need **one**, depending on your processor.

> ‚ö†Ô∏è **Important:**  
> If you remove a microcode package **after installation**, and your bootloader references it, your system **may fail to boot**.  
> Only remove the unused one if you are comfortable editing your bootloader entries.

> üí° After removal, update your bootloader configuration to reflect the change (e.g., regenerate GRUB or edit `loader.conf` if using systemd-boot).

---

### Ensure You Have a Network Connection

Refer to the instructions in the **Pacman Live** section above if needed.

### Initialize Pacman

`pacman` will not work until keys are initialized. Run the following:

```
ab-pacman-keys

```

This will:

- Create keys  
- Refresh the package cache  
- Update the `archlinux-keyring`

---

### Basic Package Usage

Search for packages:

```bash
sudo pacman -Ss <package-name>
```

Install a package:

```bash
sudo pacman -S <package-name>
```
